# Daily News  
  
### Description  
  
Daily News is a news web-app project with a simple, modern looking UI. This project aims at providing updated news grouped by categories like sports, business, entertainment, science, etc. populated by integrating [News API](https://newsapi.org/). I am a beginner in web development so I'm building this project to practice my web development skills.  
  
### Problems Solved by this project  
    
- Obviously saves paper and a lot of hassle for it.  
- Everything (news) at one place.
- Updates faster than traditional media.  
- More efficient to use in general compared to traditional media.  
  
### Technologies Used  
  
- React.js -    
I used React.js because it is the most popular JavaScript Library. It really enables developer to make reusable components which makes workflow and the development process a lot more efficient and faster. React.js is so good that it is compared against most popular Frameworks- Angular.js and Vue.js. For these reasons, a lot of organizations use React.js for their fontend devlopment, so I thought it would be beneficial for me to know React.js.  
  
- Tailwind CSS -  
I used Tailwind css in order to save time and effort and making things more efficient. It is a CSS Framework which enables developer to style components through class names without actually leaving the current document (HTML or JS document in my case). I like Tailwind better than Bootstrap because I wanted some freedom in styling components and Tailwind is way more customizable by default compared to Bootstrap. Bootstrap really shines in pre-built components, those can be used just like LEGO pieces for styling. I used Tailwind along with Tailblocks, a set of pre-built components because I wanted focus more on React.js.  
  
Everybody faces challenges in whatever they do. I faced some of them too, a lot more as beginner. Learning JSX itself was a bit of a challenge, it is new to me but then eventually working on a few projects helped me. Extracting little component to make them dynamic (like buttons) was a challenge but then after a few repetations along the project work, it became easier. Hooks were a challenge, again its all new to me.  
  
So I'm facing all the challenges that every beginner faces. It might not seem much but for a beginner it is a phase that everybody has to go through.  
  
As for the features, this app doesn't reload everything after clicking something beacause of React.js. It only loads what is changed (doesn't reload common stuff like header, footer, etc). For now my focus is to create a functional Daily news web-app with most common features and nothing too unique. Maybe in future I'll try to implement searching and sorting functionality.  
  
### How to run this ?  
  
- Install Node.js and NPM.  
- Clone this repo or download zip file (click that blue colour button with "code" written on it) and extract it.  
- Open a terminal emulator, cd to the directory of project and type "npm install" to install all dependencies and related packages which are present in package.json file, everything will be installed using this file.  
- Type "npm run start" in terminal emulator.

> **Warning**  
> Never delete package.json and package-lock.json. Never touch them if you're new. Read about those files, gain knowledge about it and then if it is required, do required things in those files.
